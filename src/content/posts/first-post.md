Welcome to my new blog about projects and learning! Here I will share my learning journey, 3D related stuff, shaders and everything related to creative coding.

# Astro

I recently revamped this website using Astro, it was initially made with Next.js but I got curious about learning a new technology. It is incredible how easily you can mix UI libraries/frameworks to work in the same project.

Astro's user-friendly nature made learning and integrating components from Next.js seamless.
